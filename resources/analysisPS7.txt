MainApplication:
    functions:
        readPromptFileAndReturnList: O(N)
        getTotalvertices: O(N^2)
        executeMethodForObject: internally makes use of Interpreter.readApplications which takes O(n^2)


Interpreter:
    functions:
        __addEdges: O(2) constant time
        readApplications: O(N^2)
            one loop for reading the lines of files and other for iterating through each of the values of lines
            and fill the matrix
        __getAllLanguages: O(N)
        showAll: O(n)+O(n) = O(2N)
        displayCandidates: O(N), just need to iterate for all the columns
        findDirectTranslator: for each langA, we are getting the candidates and then we are iterating for each candidate for
                                all the columns and matching with the langB

                                O(N)+O(N^2)= O(N^2)
        __bfs: this is the modified version of breadth first search. O(V+E)
        findTransRelation: this internally makes use of __bfs
                            O(V+E) + O(N) + O(N) = O(N)

        __findMinimumInterpreters: this is private method internally making use of depth first search.
                                    O(V+E)
        displayHireList: this method internally makes use of __findMinimumInterpreters.
                            O(N) + O(V+E) = O(N)
